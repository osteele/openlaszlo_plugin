Description:
    The rest_controller generator creates a controller that implements
    the OpenLaszlo REST API.

    The generator takes a controller name as its argument.
    The controller name may be given in CamelCase or under_score and should
    not be suffixed with 'Controller'.  To create a controller within a
    module, specify the controller name as 'module/controller'.

    The generator is an alternative to the use of the scaffolding method:
      class ContactsController < ApplicationController
        rest_scaffold :contact
      end

    The file that the generator creates differs from this in that it contains
    an explicit methods for each action.  This is more verbose, but is a
    better starting point for customizing the methods.


Example:
    ./script/generate rest_controller contacts

    This will create:
        app/controllers/contacts_controller.rb
        app/helpers/contacts_helper.rb
        test/functional/contacts_controller_test.rb
