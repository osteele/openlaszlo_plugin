Description:
    The applet generator creates an OpenLaszlo application source file and
    a view that displays it.  If the model and controller do not exist, it
    creates these as well.

    The generator takes a controller name as its first argument, and the
    applet name as its second argument.
    
    The controller name may be given in CamelCase or under_score and should
    not be suffixed with 'Controller'.  To create a controller within a
    module, specify the controller name as 'module/controller'.
    
Example:
    ./script/generate applet contacts applet

    This will create:
        app/applets/contacts/contacts.lzx
        app/views/contacts/applet.html.erb

Notes:
    The pathname to the applet does not incorporate the name of
    the controller.  This accomodates the common case where there are
    a small number of applets (maybe just one), that communicate with
    multiple controllers.  It does mean that 'generate applet addresses
    applet' will overwrite the applet created by 'generate applet contacts
    applet'.  It is best to generate one applet and then hook it to
    multiple controllers.
