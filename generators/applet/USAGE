Description:
    The applet generator creates an OpenLaszlo application source file and
    a view that displays it.

    The generator takes a controller name as its first arguments, and an
    applet name as its second.
    
    The controller name may be given in CamelCase or under_score and should
    not be suffixed with 'Controller'.  To create a controller within a
    module, specify the controller name as 'module/controller'.

Example:
    ./script/generate applet contacts applet

    This will create:
        app/applets/contacts/contacts.lzx
        app/views/contacts/applet.rhtml

Note that the pathname to the applet does not incorporate the name of the controller.  This accomodates the common case where there are a small number of applets (maybe just one), that communicate with multiple controllers.
