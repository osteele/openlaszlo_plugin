Description:
    The rest_controller generator creates a controller that implements
    the OpenLaszlo REST API.    If the model does not exist, it
    creates it as well.

    The generator takes a controller name as its argument.
    The controller name may be given in CamelCase or under_score and should
    not be suffixed with 'Controller'.  To create a controller within a
    module, specify the controller name as 'module/controller'.

Example:
    ./script/generate rest_controller contacts

    This will create:
        app/controllers/contacts_controller.rb
        app/helpers/contacts_helper.rb
        test/functional/contacts_controller_test.rb
