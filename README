= OpenLaszlo Rails Plugin

The OpenLaszlo Rails plugin makes it easy to use
OpenLaszlo[openlaszlo.org] client-side applications with Rails.  It
includes a generator and helper for creating OpenLaszlo applications
and displaying them within Rails views.

For example, the following shell command will create a Rails model named +Contact+, a REST controller named +ContactController+, an OpenLaszlo application named +applet+, and a view named <tt>contact/applet</tt>.  At this point the applet will automatically display records that it retrieves, via the controller, from the model.
  > ./script/generate applet contact applet


=== Generators

The plugin defines the following generator, that can be used to
quickly create an OpenLaszlo stub application and a view that displays
it.  Use the <tt>--help</tt> option with a generator for more
information.

  ./script/generate applet # generates an OpenLaszlo source file, and a view to hold it


=== Rails Tasks

The plugin defines the following tasks:
  rake openlaszlo:build:applets
    Recompile any applets in the app/applets directory

  rake openlaszlo:clobber:applets
    Clean the applets directory

  rake openlaszlo:install:javascripts
    Copies the OpenLaszlo javascripts to public/javascripts


== Requirements

* Rails 2.0 or later.  (Might work with earlier versions, but is untested with them.)
* {OpenLaszlo 3.1 or later}[openlaszlo.org]
* The {OpenLaszlo ruby gem}[ropenlaszlo.rubyforge.org]


== Installation
0: Install OpenLaszlo, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails.

1: Install the ROpenLaszlo gem:
  > gem install ropenlaszlo

2: Install this plugin.  In your rails application directory:
  > ./script/plugin install svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/laszlo-plugin/tags/openlaszlo

3: Set your +OPENLASZLO_HOME+ environment variable to the directory that contains the OpenLaszlo SDK.  If the following prints anything, you've got it right:
  > grep Laszlo "$OPENLASZLO_HOME/README.txt"

4: Set your +OPENLASZLO_URL+ environment variable to the web location of the Open<tt></tt>Laszlo server; for example, <tt>http</tt><tt>://localhost:8080/lps-3.1.1</tt>.  This step is optional in other platforms (although it makes compilation faster), but is {mandatory on Windows}[OpenLaszlo bug 1428}[www.openlaszlo.org/jira/browse/LPP-1428].


== Usage

In your RAILS application directory:

1: Create an applet, and a view that displays it:
  > ./script/generate applet contacts applet

2: Compile the applet:
  > rake applets

Now launch the server (<tt>script/server</tt>), and you can view your applet at <tt>ht</tt><tt>tp:127.0.0.1:3000/contacts/applet</tt>.
