= OpenLaszlo Rails Plugin

The Open<tt></tt>Laszlo Rails plugin makes it easy to use
OpenLaszlo[openlaszlo.org] client-side applications with Rails.  It
includes a generator and helper for creating Open<tt></tt>Laszlo applications
and displaying them within Rails views.

For example, the following shell command will create an Open<tt></tt>Laszlo application named +applet+, and a view named <tt>controller/index</tt>.  Requesting the view will recompile the applet.
  $ ./script/generate applet contact applet


=== View Helper

The plugin introduces two view helpers.  +swfobject_tag+ generates
code that embeds a flash object in the page (using the
swfobject[http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/] JavaScript library).
+applet_tag+ additionally recompiles the applet if it is out of date,
and swaps in a version of the applet compiled with the debug flag set
if the +debug+ query parameter is present in the request that resulted
in the call -- both of these additional features are available only in
development mode.


=== Generators

The plugin defines the following generators, that can be used to
quickly create an Open<tt></tt>Laszlo stub application and a view that displays
it.

This generates an Open<tt></tt>Laszlo source file in <tt>app/applets/my-app</tt>:
  $ ./script/generate applet my-app

This also creates a model and view at <tt>/my-controller/index</tt>
that displays the applet.  When the app's source changes, requesting
the view recompiles the app.
  $ ./script/generate applet my-app my-controller index


=== Rails Tasks

The plugin defines the following tasks:
  # Recompile any applets in the app/applets directory
  rake openlaszlo:build:applets

  # Clean the applets directory
  rake openlaszlo:clobber:applets

  # Copies the swfobject javascripts to public/javascripts
  rake openlaszlo:install:javascripts


== Requirements

* Rails 2.0 or later.  (Might work with earlier versions, but is untested with them.)
* {OpenLaszlo 3.1 or later}[openlaszlo.org]
* The {OpenLaszlo ruby gem}[github.com/osteele/ropenlaszlo]


== Installation
0: Install Open<tt></tt>Laszlo, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails.

1: In <tt>config/environment</tt>, place the following code inside the <tt>Rails::Initializer.run</tt> block:
  config.gem 'osteele-ropenlaszlo', :lib => 'openlaszlo', :version => '>= 0.6.3', :source => 'http://gems.github.com'

2: Install the {ropenlaszlo}[github.com/osteele/ropenlaszlo] gem:
  $ sudo rake gems:install

3: Install this plugin:
  $ ./script/plugin install http://github.com/osteele/openlaszlo-plugin

4: Set the +OPENLASZLO_HOME+ environment variable to the directory that contains the Open<tt></tt>Laszlo SDK.  The first line below is an example of this in bash (although
you will probably want to put this in your <tt>.bashrc</tt> or <tt>.profile</tt>).
The second line of shell script will tell you whether you've set it right.
  $ export OPENLASZLO_HOME="/Applications/Open</tt><tt>Laszlo Server 4.2.0.2"
  $ grep -qs Laszlo "$OPENLASZLO_HOME/README.txt" && echo yes || echo no


== Usage

In your RAILS application directory:

1: Create an applet, and a view that displays it:
  $ ./script/generate applet my-applet controller index

2: Compile the applet (this step is optional):
  $ rake openlaszlo:build:applets

Now launch the server (<tt>script/server</tt>), and you can view your applet at <tt>ht</tt><tt>tp:127.0.0.1:3000/controller/index</tt>.


== Using the Compile Server

The steps described above use the Open<tt></tt>Laszlo command-line compiler to compile applications.  A faster technique, although one that requires more configuration, is to leave the Open<tt></tt>Laszlo server running as a compile server.

The instructions for setting up an Open<tt></tt>Laszlo compile server are {here}[http://wiki.github.com/osteele/openlaszlo-plugin/using-the-compile-server].
